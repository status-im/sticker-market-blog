More specifically, any utility token needs to be able to objectively evaluate various features and utilities of their platform, and how they affect the entirety of their ecosystem. For instance, we need to be able to ask questions like the following: “How can we objectively measure the use of SNT if it gets used in feature X as a function of our user base?
